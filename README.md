# Overview

Playbooks are used by professionals to store or encapsulate knowledge on various topics and tactics. You will use these again and again in the field to deal with situations as they arise. The idea is that you donâ€™t want to wait until a challenging situation arises to have a plan; you want to already have potential mitigation strategies in your playbook that can help kickstart your process toward finding solutions.

Remember, playbooks should not be confused with typical portfolios. You will not be presenting your playbook to an employer or bringing it to an interview. However, it will prepare you to successfully present yourself and your knowledge when approaching an interview or when meeting with a key stakeholder about an issue that arose.

Professional playbooks are continuing to become more commonly shared within the industry.
